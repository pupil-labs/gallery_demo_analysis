# Analysing Areas on Interest with Pupil Invisible and the Reference Image Mapper
This repository contains jupyter notebooks with code examples how to load, display, define and aggregate Areas of Interest
and fixations inside them.

The notebooks work with eye-tracking data recorded with the [pupil invisible][invisible_link], and preprocessed in 
[pupil cloud][cloud_link]. The data for all these notebooks can be found in this [Demo Workspace][workspace_link].

A high level overview of the notebook content can be found in this [blog post][blog_link_analysis].

The material here is intended as a starting point to learn more about analyzing gaze data inside 
Areas of Interest.
